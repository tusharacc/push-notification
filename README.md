# Angular Push Notifications

In this tutorial, we are going to take a look at how to display push notifications using angular.

These push notifications will be the same as the native notifications you get on your smartphone or your computer.

Also the user does not have to be on your site to receive the notification because of service workers.

Doesn't that sound great?

Native app like feature in the browser!
